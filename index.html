        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Considering the lifespan of pets such as dogs and cats, a responsible pet owner prefers regular visits to the veterinarian at least twice a year. This strategy will significantly help to maintain the health of pets and it further leads to the identification of health issues if any. It is quite challenging for pet owners to visit doctors as pets prefer to stay in their comfortable space and pets further identify that they are going to visit the veterinarian.</p>
